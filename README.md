This project implements the K-Means++ clustering algorithm using Python with C API to improve efficiency and performance. K-Means++ optimizes the initial selection of cluster centroids, resulting in faster convergence and more accurate clustering compared to standard K-Means. By combining Python's data-handling capabilities and the speed of C, this implementation achieves efficient clustering on large datasets. Libraries used include NumPy and Pandas for Python, with core computation handled through the C API for optimized runtime.
